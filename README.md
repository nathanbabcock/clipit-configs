# Hypetrigger Configs

Hypetrigger uses JSON config files to automatically detect clips and events in videos. Download Hypetrigger here: <https://hypetrigger.io>

## Default installation

When you install Hypetrigger, the configs in this repo are automatically installed into this folder:

```txt
%APPDATA%/Hypetrigger/configs
```

## Adding your own configs

You can create your own configs to support games that Hypetrigger doesn't already include, or even for non-gaming use cases. You can use the UI inside Hypetrigger to create and tune your own configs, or you can directly create JSON files like the ones in this repository.

All JSON files in the folder will be automatically loaded by the program next time it starts.

Read more about custom configs here: <https://hypetrigger.io/custom-configs>.

## Sharing with the community

Once you've created a config that works well, you can share it with other users of Hypetrigger on Discord in the `#custom-configs` channel. <https://hypetrigger.io/discord>

You can also make a PR on this repo to directly include your configs into the official set.
